# pico

`pico` is a Pi Agent-centered domain extension for one resident AI support staff
member in an after-school care facility.

The repository is in foundation stage. It currently defines the package shape,
module boundaries, quality gates, and active provider decisions.

## Development

Use Node.js 24 or newer. CI runs on Node 24.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run all local checks:

```bash
just check
```

Run the same parallel gate shape used by CI:

```bash
just ci
```
